# TCS-Project
Traction Control System for an Electric Vehicle

The objectives of the project were to design, develop and test an electronic traction control system (TCS) for an electric vehicle. If a difference in speed between 
the wheels is detected, information is sent to the motor controller to reduce the speed where more revolutions per second are detected, thus controlling the traction 
of the vehicle. Main hardware resources used where: Arduino UNO development board with Atmega328p microcontroller, Nano development board with Atmega328p microcontroller,
MMA8452 digital accelerometer for vehicle motion direction estimation, speed sensors for wheel rotation speed acquisition, CAN interface for communication with the engine
controller, L298N dual motor driver, DC-DC 12V-5V converter, linear potentiometer of 1.1 Mohm, acting as accelerator pedal, 12V power supply. The software used was
Arduino IDE and the code was written in C++
